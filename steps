Steps for the GUI Presentation

1.) Do the presentation!
2.) Give out Glossary!
3.) Open GitHub Desktop
4.) Clone this repo
5.) Look in the History of "Ein kleines Gedicht"
6.) Show the diff
7.) Make a new Branch, everybody can make his own language
8.) Tanslate the thing 
9.) Commit
10.)Push
11.)Pull the others
12.) Make a few little changes but do NOT commit!
13.) Try Change the branch
14.) Get a message (and don't change)
15.) Stash
16.) Look into the file, the change is gone!
17.) Make a diffrent change and stash
17.) b) Notice that you can only stash once! This is a drawback of GitHub Desktop!
18.) Change the branch and not fail
19.) Unstash
GitHub Desktop CAN NOT "go back in time" or have big stashes or something in this direction. It can do just the basic but can do them very very good!
