### I use this old repo to explain stuff, first the fact that the README.md in GitHub is always coded with the Markdown syntax

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to the Tutorial that explain all!](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

But for more complex task try using the wiki with mediawiki syntax!

**So lets start**

```
git init
```
