### I use this old repo to explain stuff, first the fact that the README.md in GitHub is always coded with the Markdown syntax

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to the Tutorial that explain all!](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

But for more complex task try using the wiki with mediawiki syntax!

**So lets start**

```
#this will make an empty repo, try it now
git init 
#if you want to clone this then use
git clone git@github.com:fprott/git_test.git
#be ware, if you operate behind a firewall or do not want to configure the computer with your certificate and use a private repo then http is better !
git clone https://github.com/fprott/git_test.git
```
**Now make the standart operations**
